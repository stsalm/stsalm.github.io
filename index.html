<h1>It's Dolphin Time!</h1>
<p>Weird dolphin fact:</p>
<p>Dolphins deliberately handle pufferfish causing them to release toxins as a defence mechanism. These toxins can be deadly in high doses, but also have a narcotic effect â€“ and are a powerful hallucinogenic, which dolphins appear to enjoy. </p>
